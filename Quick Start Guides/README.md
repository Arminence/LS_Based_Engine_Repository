## Soon to be basic troubleshooting

## I've flashed my PCM with a new OS and now my engine won't run.
Don't panic, there are a few things you need to check.
> Is VATS disabled?
If VATS isnt disabled and you are not using the orignial key then the engine may crank with no spark output or run for one to three seconds before dying.
> Do the VINs match?
If its still in a stock vehicle make sure that the VINs match, the PCM and BCM need to have the same VIN saved to them or else you get a no-start.
> Can you read the BIN that was saved to the PCM?
If you can't read the BIN that most likely means something went wrong during the writing process, depending on when things went wrong this is usually recoverable by simply pulling the PCM fuses?
> My engine still isn't running.

## TunerPro is shwoing me some crazy numbers that don't make sense.
Check that the XDF matches your OS, if it doesn't you can get some weird jibberish that doesn't make sense.
