#Basic Troubleshooting

### I've flashed my PCM with a new OS and now my engine won't run.
#### Don't panic, there are a few things you need to check.

* __Is VATS disabled?__

If VATS isnt disabled and you are not using the orignial key then the engine may crank with no spark output or run for one to three seconds before dying.

* __Do the VINs match?__

If its still in a stock vehicle make sure that the VINs match, the PCM and BCM need to have the same VIN saved to them or else you get a no-start.

* __Can you read the BIN that was saved to the PCM?__

If you can't read the BIN that most likely means something went wrong during the writing process, depending on when things went wrong this is usually recoverable by simply pulling the PCM fuses. If you can, try doing a quick comparison between what you pulled off of it and what you intended to flash onto the PCM, you may have just encountered some weird write issue. 

* __My engine still isn't running.__

Reach out online at pcmhacking.net , those guys are wizards and can help work their internet magic.

### TunerPro is showing me some crazy numbers that don't make sense.

* __Check that the XDF matches your OS.__

This is a pretty easy mistake to make, if they don't match you can get some pretty funky values.

* __Try re-reading the BIN from your PCM.__

You may have just expereienced a wierd connection issue, re-reading is the easiest way to check.
